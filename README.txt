Last week we both worked dilligently, switching shifts between writing code and theorizing.
We created a scoring heuristic that takes into account corners, corner adjacents, edges, and 
edge adjacents. A two-ply minimax tree was developed
This week both of us had a lot of work with finals. Improvements such as deepening minimax depth
were discussed but nothing working was written.
